# NumberImageDetection 

The following project represents my attempt in analyzing the MNIST dataset using the Keras machine learning library.

# Installation

You can run this project under the Anaconda's Jupyter Notebbok. The main libraries are: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Keras.
The project requires the keras library which will not be available under the Anaconda platform. To install it check: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/keras

# Description

The project is meant to be an exploration towards how Deep Learning works. I took some inspiration from a lot of different Kaggle notebooks and Kaggle tutorial at: 
https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning and https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision. M

# Files

The main files is the Digits Recognition.ipynb notebook. The input folders contains the datasets that will be used in the notebook. 

# Acknowledgement

The MNIST dataset is a famous dataset. They can be found everywhere around the web but for this specific version, I took it from Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview
